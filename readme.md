# Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App

This repository contains the code for a project developed through the "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App" module. This module is designed as an introductory course to HTML, teaching the fundamentals of web development by building a fun and interactive cat photo application.

## Description

Throughout this course, I have learned how to use various HTML tags to structure a webpage effectively. HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. By creating this cat photo app, I have practiced adding images, buttons, and other interactive elements to a webpage.

The project serves as a foundational stepping stone for understanding how HTML is used to create the skeleton of a webpage. It includes the implementation of:

- Text formatting tags such as headers and paragraphs
- Image insertion using the `<img>` tag
- Link creation with the `<a>` tag
- Organizing content with containers like `<div>` and `<section>`
- Form building with `<input>`, `<label>`, and `<fieldset>` for user interaction

## Getting Started

This code is well-commented and can be a reference for basic HTML structures. You can clone the repository and open the `main.html` file in any web browser to see the project in action.

### Prerequisites

No prerequisites are needed for viewing the HTML file. However, if you wish to edit and view changes live, you might want to set up a local server or use an IDE with live preview features like Visual Studio Code.
